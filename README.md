## Using the JSON Schema

This repository uses a JSON schema from the VS Code's extension [OTEL Validator](https://github.com/nimbushq/otel-validator) in order to provide validation for the collector configuration file.

To get the latest schema version, either clone the repository and copy the schema from `assets/schema.json` or directly download the file from [the repository](https://github.com/nimbushq/otel-validator/blob/main/assets/schema.json).
